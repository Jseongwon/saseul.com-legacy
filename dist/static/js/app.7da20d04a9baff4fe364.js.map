It implements\n          HAP-2 consensus algorithm, which enables the engine to reach finality\n          between max 3 seconds and displays max 5000 transactions per second on\n          average, which is enough to cover most industrial needs, considering\n          that VISA processes around 1700 transactions per second. In addition,\n          SASEUL smart contracts are designed to be developer-friendly since\n          developers can draft a contract in any programming language they wish\n          as long as the compiled product is in JSON format - a prominent\n          data-interchange format. Therefore, our ultimate goal in uploading\n          SASEUL AMI in Amazon Marketplace is to facilitate blockchain\n          development around the world in various industries simply because\n

<div class=\"bass-price-policy\">SASEUL BaaS Policy</div>\n      <div class=\"Line\"></div>\n      <div class=\"policy-content\">\n        Basic Package is BaaS under SASEUL version 0.5 and is more like a free\n        trial. The core features of blockchain are all included but to utilize a\n        more service-like features, SASEUL version 1.0 must be implemented.\n        Therefore, users can test the performance of the engine using the Basic\n        Package and will have the chance to consider switching to the Silver\n        Package.\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"policy-content\">&nbsp;</div>\n      <div class=\"policy-content\">\n        Silver Package will be the main product of BaaS at ArtiFriends.\n        Consumers can install SASEUL blockchain and utilize all functionalities\n        available in version 1.0 with a charge of USD 0.5 per hour. The Silver\n        Package is expected to have the highest demand among the BaaS packages\n        at ArtiFriends.\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"policy-content\">&nbsp;</div>\n      <div class=\"policy-content\">\n        Gold Package is identical to the Silver Package except ArtiFriends will\n        take care of the installation process. The main targets will be\n        corporates as they are willing to spend outsourcing fees when\n        implementing new technology.\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"policy-content\">&nbsp;</div>\n      <div class=\"policy-content\">\n        Last but not least, Platinum Package targets corporates that wish to\n        implement a private blockchain server within their firm. These are firms\n        that want internal blockchain servers, unlike the major clouds like AWS,\n        Azure and GCP. Since SASEUL will not be on a designated cloud server,\n        there may be difficulties customizing and implementing internal\n        blockchain servers. ArtiFriends will also provide technology and\n        consulting supports for those particular cases.\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"change-content\">&nbsp;</div>\n      <div

The fundamental\n          consensus is derived from the SASEUL Consensus Algorithm.

Validators decide whether to accept or deny based on\n          two given standards: <br /><br />\n          <span class=\"box-3-italic\"\n            >- Is the sender really the one who requested the transaction?<br\n          /></span>\n          Signature, which is generated by a private key, is included in a\n          transaction request. One can easily figure out the validity of a\n          signature using a public key. And finally, one can trust the public\n          key by comparing it to the address that requested the transaction.<br /><br />\n          <span class=\"box-3-italic\">- Is this transaction valid?<br /></span>\n          Assuming that the sender is the one who requested the transaction,\n          transaction itself must now be validated. For example, in the existing\n          cryptocurrency networks, the system checks whether the sender has\n          enough tokens to satisfy the request and whether the recipient address\n          is valid.\n        </div>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"detail-box-3\">\n        <div class=\"detail-box-3-title\">・ Round Validating</div>\n        <div class=\"detail-box-3-content\">\n          <span class=\"box-3-bold\">1. Round sync<br /></span>\n          All validators store the length of their current operating chain and\n          we named this value a round. In other words, round is the current\n          block number at which a validator is operating within that chain\n          lifecycle. In order to reach consensus among themselves, validators\n          must check the rounds of other validators. Instead of broadcasting\n          one's own round, SASEUL requires a validator to request other\n          validators' rounds.<br />\n          <img src=\"../../assets/infographic/Round-Validating1.jpg\" />\n          <span class=\"caption\">\n            Each validator requests rounds from other validators to sync with\n            and validate blocks from rounds ahead. </span\n          ><br /><br />\n          If there is a validator several rounds ahead, other validators who are\n          several rounds behind would have to sync all rounds ahead and validate\n          those extra rounds. If there are multiple nodes operating ahead, a\n          lagging node would sync and validate data from the node operating at\n          the highest round. If there are invalid data or transaction included,\n          the recipient validator can remove that node from its tracker. If\n          there are no validators operating ahead, one can participate in a new\n          round and generate blocks with other validators in the same round.\n        </div>\n        <br /><br />\n        <div class=\"detail-box-3-content\">\n          <span class=\"box-3-bold\">2.

Each validator would generate a block and the\n          consensus for that block would take place in the following round sync.\n          In other words, if there is a malicious node including invalid data in\n          a block, then that node would be removed from the non-evil nodes'\n          trackers and thus will be forked from the network.<br />\n          <img src=\"../../assets/infographic/Round-Validating2.jpg\" />\n          <span class=\"caption\">\n            If there are validators operating in the same round, all validators\n            in that round generate a block for that round and compare block hash\n            among themselves.

If the hash values are different, one will sync\n          block with the validator that delivered the different hash value and\n          check for any other differences. Based on the result, one can either\n          update to re-commit or completely fork the network. However, no voting\n          takes place after the block update voting takes place only once during\n          a single round.<br />\n          <img
